*Note*: A lot of websites use *Infinite Scrolling* instead of *Pagination*.

*Pagination* is the method of splitting up content into several pages and providing a set of links you usually see at the bottom or top of a page that allows you to go to the next or previous page, or choose a page number you want manually.


## Good Practices for Pagination
+ Pagination should be intuitive
+ Provide Reasonable Page Length
  * Safe option for search results is to display 25 to 75 items per page. However, this number is very approximate. The real number will depend on the site’s context and industry.
+ Provide large clickable elements
  * It’s simply essential to make the targets big enough so users will be able to spot and hit them faster and easier.
+ Don't use underlines
+ Identify the current page
  * “Where am I?” is one of the fundamental questions users need to answer to successfully navigate. Users rely on visual cues from navigation elements to answer this critical question. That’s why you should identify the current page clearly with a proper styling. Your users need to know where they are right now. The current page should be significantly different in style from the other pages, so that users can easily keep track of where they are. And don’t rely on color alone, ensure that the status is understandable when viewed without color!
+ Space out page links
  * There should be enough space between each page link so that a user can’t accidentally click on the wrong page number.
+ Provide **`Previous`** and **`Next`** links
  * In order to create a decent pagination control, you should clearly separate them from the page numbers and give them sufficient distance or unique styling so that they can't be mistaken as a page.

  (Use Page Numbers or Next/Previous combination?
  + In general, you should display page numbers when the amount of pages are small, but go with a simple previous and next buttons when it’s big.)

+ Don't use **`First`** and **`Last`** links
  * Some paginations have first and last links that allow users to skip to the first or last page. Sometimes the first and last links are displayed using double arrowheads, which users can mistakenly press thinking that they’re the single arrowheads’s next and previous navigation buttons.
  * Labeling the links “first” and “last” also causes clicking errors because of its proximity to the “next” and “previous” link.
  * In most cases, the first and last links aren’t necessary because users prefer to view content in chronological order. There’s no reason for them to start from the last page unless they’re trying to find content from the past that they’ve already seen before.
  * However, there is practical value in providing the option to go back to the first page. The first page often has the most relevant and recent content. After paginating the user might want to go back to the first page without having to click the “previous” link over and over. **You should display the first page link as the number one, such as “1”.**

#### The User must know:
+ Where they are
+ Where they've been *(see below )*
+ Where they can go

(*The special styling for pages which user already visited is a useful enhancement, but can be included in **Should Have**
section of project planning*)

Here is an example of pagination with visited links
### [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com)

The only thing I didn't like about this example in particular, they look like they are disabled links but it's just the matter of styling them properly.

## Use cases
Below are different websites with their pagination. I will try to analyze each case according to good practices mentioned at the top of this document.

### [Naldz Graphics](http://naldzgraphics.net/)
<img src="images/confusing_last_link.png">

This pagination has confusing **`Next`** and **`Last`** links. The double right pointing angles on both links make it unclear what those links are really for.

### [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)
<img src="images/flickr.png">

Just an example of how **`Previous`** and **`Next`** links are spaced out from page links.
- There is no **`Last`** link but there is a hellip link if the user wants to see next set of pages.

### [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.de)
<img src="images/vodafone.png">

An interesting example of organizing pages.
  * There is **`First`** link
  * 5 page links displayed
  * double right pointing angles link indicating the links between page 5 and page 10
  * links 10, 20, 30 displayed for users who want to jump over some amount of pages if there are alot of results
  * hellip link indicating more pages
  * **`Last`** link

Some paginations use a last page number as a **`Last`** link, some use **`Last`** link itself. This depends on the website's or app's content and needs. When there are a lot of pages users usually don't visit the last pages. If it's important that the user visits the last pages (though it doesn't garantee that), it's better to use hellip link + **`Last`** link. 
If it isn't then instead of **`Last`** link it's preferred to use last page number link.

### Wallmart

<img src="images/wallmart/first_page1.png">

- The current page is 1. The green background of the page link identifies which page we are on.
- Page 1 also serves as a **`First`** link.
- The page links are spaced out.
- The last page number serves as the **`Last`** link and also indicates how many pages total.
- There is a **`Next`** button in the shape of right arrow.

<img src="images/wallmart/middle1.png">

- Here we moved to page 4. 
- We now have the **`Previous`** link.
- We can also see that when we point at desired link there is a hover effect which visually helps to navigate and click on the link.

<img src="images/wallmart/hellips1.png">

- Now we are on page 6.
- We have **`Previous`** and **`Next`** links
- We have first and last page numbers as **`First`** and **`Last`** links
- There are also hellips on each side and an offset of two links on both sides.

<img src="images/wallmart/last_page1.png">

- Now we are on last page
- we don't have the **`Next`** link anymore
- we have only one hellip in the beginning
- The way pagination looks now limits our access to the middle pages, we have to get to the first page in order to get to the middle. 

*Summary*: This pagination for me as a user was very intuitive, easy to navigate. I think it is a very good idea to remove a **`Last`** link in the shape of arrow when we are on the last page. That way we do not confuse the user with unneeded options.



### Etsy

The pagination from [etsy.com](https://www.etsy.com) is similar to [wallmart.com](https://www.wallmart.com) pagination. 

On the first page:

<img src="images/etsy/first_page1.png">

In the middle:

<img src="images/etsy/middle1.png">

Further in the middle when hellips appear:

<img src="images/etsy/hellips1.png">

On the last page:

<img src="images/etsy/last_page1.png">

*Summary*: Though it's pretty similar to the previous one it was nice and easy to click on the links due to the borders and padding they have.
