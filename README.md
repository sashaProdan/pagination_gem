### Good Practices for Pagination
+ Pagination should be intuitive
+ Provide large clickable areas
+ Don't use underlines
+ Identify the current page
+ Space out page links
+ Provide **`Previous`** and **`Next`** links
+ Use **`First`** and **`Last`** links where applicable (use page number instead)

#### The User must know:
+ Where they are
+ Where they've been *(see below )*
+ Where they can go

 (*The special styling for pages which user already visited is a useful enhancement, but can be included in **Should Have**
 section of project planning*)
